## Inspiration
What can be the most impractical thing I can come up with? My programmer brain kicked in and answered writing inefficient scripts which totally defeats the purpose of programming. Having extremely sophisticated machines like Quantum computers perform extremely menial task like **pattern matching** using random number generation served that purpose of inefficiency. 
## What it does
It matches the entered string by randomly generating numbers using Quantum computations which are then converted to their ASCII equivalent and matched with the string. Additionally, there is a surprise element of **ambient music** while it performs computation and at the end, it launches another surprise in the browser.
## How we built it
Using **Qiskit** library responsible for **Quantum simulation** as well as performance and the basic python modules like os and time.
## Challenges we ran into
Learning circuit building using **Quantum physics** and the simulations involved was a hectic task to overcome.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Final completion of the script working and generating random numbers using Quantum simulation is something I am proud of.
## What we learned
How quantum computations and circuit building works and how can it help to solve much greater issues in science.
## What's next for Quantello
Much more goofiness?ðŸ¤¡
